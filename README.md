Instructions can be [found on canvas](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/291031/pages/homework-2)

Please fill out all of the following sections to help us grade your submission:

## Student (to be completed individually)

* Christina Nguyen, nguy4477

## Link to Site

[ToDoIt](https://todoit-5117.web.app)

## Challenge Task

* I started the challenge task: yes
* I completed the challenge task: no (see below)

## Incomplete items
I am concerned about the progress of my group project and have chosen to forfeit some individual points in favor of earning more group points. These are the items that have not been completed:

* There are not `done/:category` pages - completed todos are shown inline
* Adding and deleting categories via the navigation menu (three dots in the upper right-hand corner) does not update the category list that shows when changing the category of an individual todo, and vice versa - would require a significant refactor
